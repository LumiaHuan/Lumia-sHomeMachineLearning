# Lumia's Home of Machine learning

Hello everybody, you can call me Lumia, this is my machine learning(ML) home.

I decide to put projects about ML into here, and welcome to build my home together.

I use lovely python to build the basement and record my work below.

If you want to contact with me, you can spark lumiahuan@gmail.com or follow [http://weibo.com/mynameishuan](http://weibo.com/1070224637/profile) . I will reply quickly.

* Only put regression part of CART. That include regression and model tree. In model tree, I use ridge and closed form.
* I put preprune algorithm in the creation of tree, and postprune by choosing
